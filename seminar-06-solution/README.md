## Coarse-grained bank

In [`src/day1/CoarseGrainedBank.kt`](src/day1/CoarseGrainedBank.kt),
make the sequential bank implementation thread-safe.
Please follow the *coarse-grained locking* scheme to make synchronization efficient.
For that, you need to use a single lock to protect all bank operations.

To test your solution, please run:

* `./gradlew test --tests CoarseGrainedBankTest` on Linux or MacOS
* `gradlew test --tests CoarseGrainedBankTest` on Windows

## Fine-grained bank

In [`src/day1/FineGrainedBank.kt`](src/day1/FineGrainedBank.kt),
make the sequential bank implementation thread-safe.
Please follow the *fine-grained locking* scheme to make synchronization efficient.
For that, you need to use per-account locks, thus, ensuring natural parallelism
when accessing different accounts. The `totalAmount()` function should acquire
all the locks to get a consistent snapshot, while `transfer(..)` should acquire
the corresponding account locks.

To test your solution, please run:

* `./gradlew test --tests FineGrainedBankTest` on Linux or MacOS
* `gradlew test --tests FineGrainedBankTest` on Windows
